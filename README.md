# Check in

So its been going really well so far, I have been able to create a few projects and learn a lot about Python. I am excited to see where this journey takes me and how much I can improve my skills by the end of the year.



# Weekly Progress
- I am going to start to do weeekly checkins to see how I am doing and what I have learned.
- I will also be posting my projects and code snippets to share with others and get feedback.


# Other learning resources
- This is where i will update what i am doing / out of this repo like books, courses, and other resources that I am using to learn Python.
- I will also be logging my progress and what I have learned from these resources & or other platorms I am using to imporve my skills.

So today insted of coding i went head and did some Hack the box challanges and it was alot of fun, I completed 3 easy rooms and I knew alot of the sutff already but was good to put it into practice. I also learned some new things about networking, I will be adding these tools to my learning resources section as well.
