# üìù Module 01: Checkpoint Answers

## Questions from README:

### 1. What's the difference between `'text'` and `"text"` in Python?

**Your Answer:**
```
[They are the same in functionality; both are used to define string literals. The choice between single quotes and double quotes is often a matter of style or convenience, especially when the string contains quotes of the other type.]
```

**Hint:** Think about functionality - are they different?

### 2. How do you repeat a string multiple times?

**Your Answer:**
```
[  you can make a string repeat by using the * opreation get print("Hello"*3) ]
```

**Example Code:**
```python
# Show an example here

print("Hello" * 3)  

```

### 3. Can you store the result of `print()` in a variable? Why or why not?

**Your Answer:**
```
[No print in a funciton not a variable, print() outputs to the console and returns None, so you cannot store its result in a variable.]
```

**Test it:**
```python
# Try this and see what happens:
# result = print("Hello") # This returns Hello  
# print(result) ## this returns None
```
