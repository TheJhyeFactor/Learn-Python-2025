# 🐍 Python Security Tools Course

Welcome to your structured Python learning path! This course transforms experimental code into a comprehensive curriculum for building security tools.

## 📚 Course Structure

The course is organized into 8 progressive modules:

1. **Core Syntax Basics** - Variables, strings, print statements
2. **Functions** (2A) & **Flow Control** (2B) - Building blocks of programs
3. **Data Structures** - Lists, dictionaries, and comprehensions
4. **Robust I/O & Exceptions** - Error handling and file operations
5. **Packages, venv & Imports** - Code organization and dependencies
6. **Filesystem & OS** (6A) & **Subprocess** (6B) - System interaction
7. **Network Programming** - Sockets, scanning, and reconnaissance
8. **Testing & Debugging** - Professional development practices

## 🎯 Learning Approach

Each module includes:
- Clear learning objectives
- Security-focused context ("Why it matters for a pentester")
- Vocabulary definitions
- Example code references
- Hands-on mini-project
- Self-assessment questions

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Read the main [ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md) for the complete learning sequence
2. Start with Module 01 and work through sequentially
3. Complete each mini-project before moving on
4. Use checkpoint questions to verify understanding

## 📂 Your Code Files

Your existing Python files have been organized by topic:
- `Hello-World.py` → Module 01 (Core Syntax)
- `calc.py` → Modules 02A (Functions) & 03 (Data Structures)
- `socket_testing.py` → Modules 06B (Subprocess) & 07 (Networking)
- `lanspy.py` → Module 07 (Networking)

## 🛡️ Security Focus

This course emphasizes practical security applications throughout. You'll progress from basic Python syntax to building your own network reconnaissance tools, learning defensive coding practices along the way.

## 📊 Progress Tracking

Track your learning journey with built-in progress tools:

1. **PROGRESS.md** - Main progress tracker with checklists and notes
2. **COMPLETED.md** - Create in each module folder when finished (use COMPLETED_TEMPLATE.md)
3. **check_progress.py** - Run to see your progress summary:
   ```bash
   python check_progress.py
   ```

### How to Mark a Module Complete:
1. Copy `COMPLETED_TEMPLATE.md` to the module folder as `COMPLETED.md`
2. Fill in your completion details, answers, and reflections
3. Update the main `PROGRESS.md` file
4. Run `check_progress.py` to see your updated stats!

## 📝 Tips for Success

- Take your time with each module
- Type out code examples rather than copy/paste
- Experiment and break things - that's how you learn!
- Complete the mini-projects to reinforce concepts
- Keep notes on what you learn
- Track your progress to stay motivated!

Happy coding, and remember: **Only test on networks you own!**
